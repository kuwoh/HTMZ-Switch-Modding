# HTMZ-Switch-Modding
My findings from modding some HTMZ mechanical switches

These switches are called "Cherry MX switch clones" these ones seem to be similar looking to Gateron switches not sure if they use the same mold though.

So far Not many know of this brand of switch (maybe it's a clone of a clone?) not sure.
